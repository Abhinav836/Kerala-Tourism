            <img src="./images/Alleppey.webp" alt="Aleppy backwaters"height="500px"width="800px">
            <p>Officially called Alappuzha, Alleppey is known for its network of canals and lagoons with beautiful backwaters and the houseboats offering overnight stays. Located in the southern part of Kerala, the coastline of Alleppey offers some of the best beaches with water sports during the dry season. Coupled with other beautiful places in Kerala like Munnar and Thekkady, Alleppey is often considered for a honeymoon or for a great family vacation. 

                Alleppey's palm-fringed inter-connect network of canal backwaters attracts a lot of tourists from all over the world. Kuttanad, also called the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala' covers a large part of Allapuzha and is home to lush green paddy fields, lakes and backwaters. 
                
                There are plenty of houseboats, homestays, and rejuvenating Ayurvedic resorts that make staying in Alleppey brilliant. The houseboats pass through the serene backwaters, where you can catch glimpses of green paddy fields, choir-making activities, and witness the life of locals in Kerala. Alleppey is also dotted with famous temples like Chettikulangara Devi Temple and Mullakkal Temple.
                
                Be sure to catch a traditional snake boat race on the Punnamada Lake in the months of August and September and try out some toddy (palm wine) at a local toddy shop for adding a touch of authenticity to your travel experience in Allepey.
